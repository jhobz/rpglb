        If a person is found engaging in such behavior RPG Limit Break staff
        will take prompt action to rectify the situation at their discretion
        including removal from the event and possible banishment from attending
        future RPGLB events. EVERYONE in attendance is expected to follow this
        policy at all times and will all be held to the same standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please report any forms of harassment to RPG Limit Break staff. We want
        to make our events safe and enjoyable for everyone and if you are the
        subject of or witness harassment please do not hesitate to ask for our
        help in resolving any such situation. Staff members can all be
        identified by their staff event badges, and Safety members can likewise
        be identified by the Safety event badges.
    </p>
    <p>
        With regards to less serious conflicts: if there is a minor conflict or
        issue, then we recommend trying to resolve the problem privately. An
        example of a minor conflict would be if your roommate is snoring loudly,
        or if there is a disagreement on whose turn it is to use a TV. If you
        find yourself unable to resolve a problem on your own, or you do not
        feel comfortable resolving the situation alone, please feel free to
        contact a staff member to assist you.

                Religious symbols are not banned, but
                demonstrations/grandstanding is not allowed. You are allowed to
                wear symbols, but do not use the stream as a platform to present
                beliefs.

                RPGLB is not an adults only event/channel. Language is to be
                channel appropriate. Inability to control language on stream may
                lead to inability to be represented on the RPGLB channel/event
                in the future. Keep language PG on stream.

        events.
