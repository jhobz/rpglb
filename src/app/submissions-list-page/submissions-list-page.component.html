		We are aware of a bug currently affecting filtering by runner name. We apologize for the inconvenience.

	<p>
		Submissions are made public as they are manually reviewed for errors. Because of this,
		<span class="info">your submissions may not appear in this list just yet.</span>
		Below are all of the public submissions. You can search the list at the top of the table, or view more results
		by using the controls at the bottom. Submissions will close at 11:59 PM EDT on Sunday, July 24th. No further
		submissions will be accepted after this time, but it may still take a bit for the final few submissions to
		become public.
