        Volunteering for RPG Limit Break
    </h2>
    <p>
        Onsite volunteer positions each have orientations covering how these
        roles operate during the event. While experience related to each
        position is a big plus, these orientations are also there to help answer
        questions and guide first-time volunteers on how to perform the tasks
        necessary to fulfill their roles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Volunteer roles for RPG Limit Break are categorized into 2 Departments:
        the Technical Department and the Community Department.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Technical Department roles cover the technical side of the marathon
        and are: Setup and Tear Down, Stream Tech, Stage Tech, and Audio Tech.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Community Department roles cover the forward facing side of the
        marathon and are: Hosting, Donation Station, Safety, Check-In, Cleaning,
        Moderation, and Social Media.
    </p>
    <p>For more information on these roles, read on!</p>
    <p class="additional">
        Unless otherwise noted, all departments will be scheduled in 4 hour
        blocks.

        Tech Department Volunteer Roles
    </h2>
    <h3>Setup &amp; Tear Down</h3>
    <p>
        This role is to help the Tech Team setup / tear down the event spaces on
        the Friday and Saturday before the event begins, and the Sunday after
        the event ends. This role will check in with Tech Staff to maintain our
        inventory spreadsheet throughout the process.
    </p>

    <h3>Stream Tech</h3>
    <p>
        Stream Technicians maintain the Stream PC and Recording PC for the
        stream. They also facilitate the completion of game transitions by
        communicating with the on-shift Producer to ensure all roles have
        completed their checklist items. Your duties will include, but are not
        limited to, monitoring the Stream PC to verify the quality of the stream
        is good and making sure correct layouts are utilized from run to run. As
        a jack-of-all-trades position, the Stream Tech is a great introduction
        to volunteering if technology is your interest. OBS familiarity is a
        plus, but is not required.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong
            >Stream Tech is a great first tech role to volunteer for our
            event.</strong

    </p>

    <h3>Stage Tech</h3>
    <p class="subtitle dim">Scheduled by game</p>
    <p>
        Stage Technicians prepare the next run on stage by connecting consoles,
        verifying equipment is working, moving chairs, cleaning and handing out
        headsets to runners, commentators, and volunteers and adjusting the
        stage camera to provide the best view for our online audience. They work
        with the Producer and the Stream Tech to ensure everything is working
        and that the run can proceed. Familiarity with Steam and with connecting
        consoles is a big plus, but is not required.
    </p>

    <h3>Audio Tech</h3>
    <p>
        Audio Technicians are responsible for all the sound, whether it goes to
        the stream, to the live audience, and even to the headsets of the
        runners and commentators. They will work under the direction of the
        Producer to set the relative levels of all audio sources, transition the
        audio feed between scenes, and maintain a clear and comfortable
        listening experience for all viewers. Familiarity with digital audio
        mixers is required. Specific knowledge of the Behringer Wing is
        beneficial, but not necessary.

        advertisements.

        down and clean surfaces per shift. This includes sections of our tech
