    <p><u><strong>Setup &amp; Tear Down</strong></u> &#x2013; This role is to help the Tech Team setup / tear down the event spaces on the Friday and Saturday before the event begins, and the Sunday after the event ends. This role will check in with Logistics Staff to maintain our inventory spreadsheet throughout the process.</p>
    <p><u><strong>Stream Tech</strong></u> &#x2013; Stream Technicians maintain the Stream PC and Recording PC for the stream. They also facilitate the completion of game transitions by communicating with the on shift Producer to ensure all roles have completed their checklist items. Your duties will include, but are not limited to, monitoring the Stream PC to verify the quality of the stream is good and making sure correct layouts are utilized from run to run. As a jack of all trades the Stream Tech is a great introduction to volunteering if technology is your interest. OBS familiarity is a plus, but is not required.</p>
    <p><strong>Stream Tech is a great first tech role to volunteer for our event.</strong></p>
    <p><u><strong>Stage Tech</strong></u> &#x2013; <em>(Scheduled by game)</em> Stage Technicians prepare the next run on stage, by connecting consoles, verifying equipment is working, moving chairs, cleaning and handing out headsets to runners, commentators, and volunteers and adjusting the stage camera to provide the best view for our online audience. They work with the Producer and the Stream Tech to ensure everything is working and that the run can proceed. Familiarity with Steam and with connecting consoles is a big plus, but is not required.</p>
    <p><u><strong>Audio Tech</strong></u> &#x2013; <em>(Scheduled by game)</em> Audio Technicians are responsible for all the sound, whether it goes to the stream, to the live audience, and even to the headsets of the runners and commentators. They will work under the direction of the Producer to set the relative levels of all audio sources, transition the audio feed between scenes, and maintain a clear and comfortable listening experience for all viewers. Familiarity with digital audio mixers is required. Specific knowledge of the Behringer Wing is beneficial, but not necessary.</p>

    <p><strong>Interview Tech</strong> &#x2013; <em>(Scheduled per Interview)</em> Interview Technicians will be required to help setup interviews. This includes, but is not limited to, adjusting audio so the interview participants have the correct audio levels, adjusting the Interview camera to make sure the interview is in frame, and coordinating with the prize team to ensure all relevant prizes are displayed during the interview. You will also be present during the interview to give a point of sight to help keep interviews focused on you and not the camera. You will need to be sure the interviewee and interviewer are on site and ready for the interview coming up.</p>
