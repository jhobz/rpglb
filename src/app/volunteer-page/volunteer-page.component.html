    <p><u><strong>Stage Tech</strong></u>  –  <em>(Scheduled by game)</em>  Stage Technicians prepare the next run on stage, by connecting consoles, verifying equipment is working, moving chairs, cleaning and handing out headsets to runners, commentators, and volunteers and adjusting the stage camera to provide the best view for our online audience.
