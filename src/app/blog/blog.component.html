    <h2 id="2022announce" class="blog-title">RPG Limit Break 2022</h2>
    <em>July 10, 2022</em>
    <hr>
    <p>We are happy to announce the event information for RPG Limit Break 2022! The marathon will take place Oct 16th-22nd in Salt Lake City, UT, and will be a hybrid event with options to participate remotely.</p>
    <p>Proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 (primary vaccine series + any eligible boosters) will be required for attendance, and N95/KN95/KF94 masks (provided by RPGLB staff) will be required in all RPGLB event spaces. A full COVID-19 safety policy will be posted before attendance registration opens.</p>
    <p>As in previous years, 100% of donations made during the event will be shared by NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) at the national level and NAMI Utah, the local NAMI chapter that works closely with our event, to provide education and support to people affected by mental illness and their families, including young adults. Both organizations raise public awareness about mental illness to reduce stigma and advocate for access to and coverage of mental health care. They provide information and resources to people around the world at <a href="https://nami.org">https://nami.org</a>.</p>
    <p>NAMI has been a great partner for RPGLB, providing support for the event and promoting the stream, so we’re happy to announce we’ll be partnering with them again for RPGLB 2022. Charity selection is something we will always re-evaluate on an annual basis, based on community &amp; viewer feedback.</p>

    <div class="timeline"><app-timeline></app-timeline></div>

    <h3>RPGLB 2022 Venue</h3>
    <p>We’ll be returning to the DoubleTree Hotel-Salt Lake City Airport for RPGLB 2022. This was the venue for RPGLB 2019 and the planned venue for RPGLB 2020 - they have generously allowed us to reschedule our 2020 event contract multiple times, and we are looking forward to returning for our first onsite charity event in 3 years. We will be renting more space than we did in 2019 to allow for a larger stream room &amp; 2nd practice room, and accommodate social distancing.</p>
    <p>The attendee cap for RPGLB 2022 will be 200 - we have an initial block of 40-50 hotel rooms per event night (weighted based on attendance data from previous events). Hotel rooms will be $123/night + tax, and room reservation details will be posted when RPGLB event registration opens on Aug 14, 2022.</p>
    <p>All attendees must be at least 18 years old - minors are welcome to attend free of charge, as long as they’re accompanied by a parent/guardian that is registered &amp; paid for the event. Minors will need to be vaccinated/masked, the same as adult attendees.</p>
    <h3>Registration Process/Attendance Costs</h3>
    <p>The attendance fee will be $50 USD for the full event. There will not be single-day passes. Registration will be done via <a href="https://rpglimitbreak.com">https://rpglimitbreak.com</a> (with Stripe used as payment processor).</p>
    <p>Game submissions will be open July 16-24, 2022 (via <a href="https://rpglimitbreak.com">https://rpglimitbreak.com</a>) and the schedule will be posted Aug 14, 2022. There will not be a separate game list release this year.</p>

    <h3>RPGLB 2020 Run Deferrals</h3>
    <p>If you are a runner whose run was accepted to RPGLB 2020, you are eligible to defer your run to RPGLB 2022. To do so, just submit your run during the RPGLB 2022 submission period (Jul 16 - 24) like normal - we are asking for RPGLB 2020 runners to formally resubmit their runs in order to confirm their interest in RPGLB 2022 &amp; provide an updated estimate/incentives; but if it’s the same game/category/runner as was on the RPGLB 2020 schedule (<a href="https://horaro.org/rpglb/2020">https://horaro.org/rpglb/2020</a>), then the games committee will auto-accept it for RPGLB 2022. If you have changed your online name since 2020, feel free to let us know that in your submission notes or via email/Discord.</p>
    <p>RPGLB 2020 runs can only be deferred to RPGLB 2022 - runs cannot be deferred to RPGLB 2023 or other future events. Runs accepted to RPGLB 2020 as co-op runs/races can be converted to solo runs if not all co-op/race participants resubmit for RPGLB 2022. Deferred runs can be done either onsite or remotely. If you are no longer interested in running the game that was accepted in 2020, then do not feel pressured to defer - no offense will be taken and your decision will not impact submissions to future RPGLB events.</p>

    <h3>RPGLB 2022 Remote Runs</h3>
    <p>In order to be inclusive to runners that are unable to attend RPG Limit Break 2022 in person due to the pandemic, we will accept a limited number of remote runs (performed from the runner’s home). Remote runs will be expected to follow the same below guidelines as onsite runs (such as retro games being played on original hardware or an official digital port). Remote run submitters will be asked to provide their availability, upload bandwidth, and whether or not they want to use a webcam.</p>

    <h3>Game Selection Criteria</h3>
    <p>Length - This will be a 6 1/2-day marathon (running roughly from noon on 10/16 to midnight the night of 10/22, for about 156 total hours). We want to have as much variety on the schedule as possible (both for games and runners), so 6+ hour runs will need to be very strong in the below areas.</p>
    <p>Donation Incentives - What we’re here for (along with having a fun week)! Can you name characters? Are there storyline branches/character choices/optional bosses that work in a speedrun route? Are there in-jokes in the game that fans would donate to see (ie the Phantom Train Suplex)? Strong donation incentives will be especially important for longer runs. Note that donation incentive submissions will be combined with game submissions in July.</p>
    <p>Entertainment - Does the run have interesting tricks/strategies that make for engaging commentary? Is there variety in the gameplay throughout the course of the run? What is the cutscene to action ratio like?</p>
    <p>Game Popularity - One of the purposes of RPGLB is giving RPGs that aren’t popular enough to make a Games Done Quick schedule a chance in the spotlight; but at the same time we want to have games on the schedule that a decent chunk of our audience has heard of and will stick around for. More obscure games also tend to have difficulty getting commentators besides the runner; and having strong run commentary is a big focus for RPGLB.</p>
    <p>Marathon Safety - How consistently can your run be finished within the estimate you give? How big of an impact does randomness have on the run? How likely would it have to be mercy killed to prevent going significantly over estimate?</p>
    <p>Language - As our main audience is going to be English-speakers, English text is generally preferred over Japanese or other languages, especially for text-heavy games. This will be less of a concern for games with skippable cutscenes and/or where the speedrun is easy to follow through animations and other non-text means. Voice acting in non-English languages is always fine, and if selectable can make for a good donation incentive.</p>
    <p>Recency - How recently has your game been featured in an RPGLB event (annual main charity events only - online community events hosted on the RPGLB Twitch channel do NOT count towards this criteria)? If it’s been in a previous event, does the game have new routing/strategies, or does your submission offer any new run categories/donation incentives?</p>
    <p>Personal Best - If your game has a community leaderboard, how close is your personal best to the fastest times? It is NOT expected for RPGLB runners to be record holders or close (especially given that the fastest speedruns of many RPGs use routes/strategies that aren’t marathon safe); but having a strong personal best makes for a stronger submission. For co-op run submissions, the individual personal bests of all submitters will be looked at by the committee (since it may fall to any of them to do the run solo if co-op partners later withdraw).</p>
    <p>Submission Video - All submissions should include a video of you doing a run of your game &amp; category within your estimate. It’s fine to use either your personal best video or a specially recorded submission video - do whatever you feel makes a stronger pitch for your run. Age of submission video is a factor in committee decisions - it’s generally preferred for submission videos to be less than 3 years old, but older videos will still be considered.</p>
    <p>Console/PC Hardware - It is expected that all console-based games will be run on original console hardware (official digital ports such as VC/PSN are fine, as are flash/reproduction cartridges). PC-based emulators (BizHawk, SNES9X, ePSXe, etc) are acceptable for submission videos, as long as runners will be prepared to run the game on console/official digital port at the marathon (including making any needed arrangements for a controller &amp; cartridge/disc). This expectation applies to remote runs as well as onsite runs.</p>
    <p>RPGLB staff will have basic NTSC-U SD consoles (SNES, PS2, etc) on hand for the stream room (though it’s recommended for runners to bring their own for practice) and gaming PCs for the stream and practice rooms. For HD consoles (PS4, PSTV, Switch, etc), it is expected for runners to bring their own consoles to ensure no installation/patching/load time issues.</p>
    <p>Defining what is/isn’t an RPG is something we do not attempt - our goal is to produce a schedule of games that appeal to fans of the RPG genre; and the RPGLB games committee decides on a case-by-case basis which offered games are/aren’t good fits for our marathon.</p>

        <h2 id="2020cancel" class="blog-title">RPGLB 2020 cancellation notice</h2>
        <em>August 2nd, 2020</em>
        <hr>
        <p>With large gatherings and domestic/international travel still discouraged or prohibited by many state and national governments, and based on feedback from many registered attendees, RPGLB staff has made the decision to cancel RPG Limit Break 2020. Fortunately, we were able to postpone our existing event contract with the DoubleTree Salt Lake City Airport until next year, so RPGLB staff will not be facing any financial or legal impact as a result of this decision.</p>
        <p>We are considering an online charity event during the planned event week (October 11-17), but if this happens it will be a separate event with new submissions. Trying to convert the existing RPGLB 2020 schedule into an online marathon would face some serious logistical problems (co-op runs in particular), and would also be unfair to the runners who submitted for an onsite event.</p>
        <p>All registered RPGLB 2020 attendees will receive refunds for their attendance fees in the near future, and all accepted runners can defer their runs to RPG Limit Break 2021 (deferment will be automatic - runners do not need to formally request it or take any other action beyond resubmitting the same game/category to RPGLB 2021). Attendees who had reservations at the event hotel will need to cancel them, either via the link included in the hotel’s confirmation email or phone call to 801-539-1515. Essentia will be reaching out to prize donors who have already made shipments to us, to discuss options for returning those prizes (if desired).</p>
        <p>While we’re extremely disappointed at being unable to hold RPG Limit Break this year, we are also grateful for all of the support and patience we’ve received from our community all throughout this process. We are looking forward to coming back with our 6th live charity event &amp; RPG speedrun community meetup in 2021!</p>
        <p>As always, feel free to e-mail <a href="mailto:management@rpglimitbreak.com">management@rpglimitbreak.com</a> with any questions, concerns, or feedback.</p>

        <h2 id="2020move" class="blog-title">RPGLB 2020 postponed to October</h2>
        <em>April 8th, 2020</em>
        <hr>
        <p class="soft">Updated on 2020/04/15: Added hotel booking link.</p>
        <p>We appreciate everyone’s patience and feedback over the past few weeks. After discussions with the venue and a survey of registered attendees (a significant number of which would have faced difficulties traveling to &amp; attending an in-person event in May), RPGLB staff has decided to postpone RPG Limit Break 2020 until <strong>October 11-17, 2020</strong>.</p>
        <p>All registrations for RPGLB 2020 will be automatically adjusted to the new event dates, and the registration &amp; attendance fee refund deadlines will be extended to <strong>September 13, 2020</strong>. Current attendees can set their planned attendance dates via their <a routerLink="/register">attendee profiles</a>. Cancellation can be requested via email to <a href="mailto:management@rpglimitbreak.com">management@rpglimitbreak.com</a>, and attendance fees will be refunded as long as requested prior to 11:59PM EDT on September 13.</p>
        <p>Attendees staying onsite at the event hotel will need to cancel their May reservations (either via the link included in the hotel’s confirmation email or phone call to 801-539-1515) and place new ones via the <a href="https://doubletree.hilton.com/en/dt/groups/personalized/S/SLCARDT-RLB-20201008/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG" target="_blank">new registration link.</a></p>
        <p>We will post a new games schedule on <strong>August 2, 2020</strong>. We would like all runners and backup runners to reconfirm their attendance by <strong>July 19, 2020</strong>, either via setting attendance dates in their <a routerLink="/register">attendee profiles</a> or by email to <a href="mailto:committee@rpglimitbreak.com">committee@rpglimitbreak.com</a>. Any runners that are unable to attend the new dates can defer their run’s acceptance to RPG Limit Break 2021 (dates/location TBD, but we will be targeting May of 2021). We are currently planning to replace any dropped runs from the existing backup list. If there are a large number of drops we may add some additional backup runs, possibly either from the original submission pool (assuming the runners are interested) or from a new open submissions period.</p>
        <p>Volunteer applications made for the May event will be carried over (pending confirmation of October attendance, which will be done via email), and <a routerLink="/volunteer">volunteer applications</a> have been reopened. The new volunteer application deadline is <strong>August 27, 2020</strong>, and the volunteer schedules will be posted <strong>September 6, 2020</strong>.</p>
        <p>The prize submission deadline will be extended to <strong>October 4, 2020</strong>. If anyone that’s submitted a prize offer would like to change or retract it, please either email <a href="mailto:prizes@rpglimitbreak.com">prizes@rpglimitbreak.com</a> or contact Essentia directly.</p>
        <p>New RPG Limit Break 2020 Timeline:<br></p>
        <div class="timeline"><app-timeline></app-timeline></div>
        <p>The RPGLB staff sincerely appreciates your patience &amp; willingness to attend our event on a postponed timeline. We heard your feedback, and we resonate strongly with our community that wants to continue this event this year, despite the complications from COVID-19. Please let us know of any concerns you have along the way, and we’re excited to put on the event in October!</p>

        <h2 id="covid19" class="blog-title">Update from staff on COVID-19</h2>
        <em>March 13th, 2020</em>
        <hr>
        <p>There’s been some concerning news this week with the US government issuing a 30 day European travel ban and the state of Utah recommending against &gt;100 person gatherings for 2 weeks; and RPGLB staff has been actively discussing our options with our hotel.  Assuming that those government actions do not get extended through our dates, as of now cancelling RPGLB 2020 (or changing it to a fully online marathon) is NOT a viable option.  The cancellation costs for our hotel contract would both deplete our reserve funds and leave staff facing some hefty out-of-pocket costs, which would severely impact our ability to put on future RPGLB events.  Rescheduling the event dates is an option, though with all of the costs that’d involve to attendees and staff, we will not be rescheduling unless absolutely necessary to protect attendee health &amp; safety.</p>
        <p>The hotel did share the below precautions they’re currently taking, and RPGLB staff will also be looking into what else we can do (and encourage attendees to do) to maintain good hygiene/sanitation within our events spaces:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Increased sanitation stations in the hotel.</li>
        <li>Made hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes available to groups hosting meetings/ events.</li>
        <li>Increased cleaning cycles in common areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our community is an awesome one and we value the trust you all have placed in us; and we do want to give assurance that if a major change ends up happening, anyone unable to attend will get 100% of their attendance fee refunded.  We’ll continue to post updates as we have them; and as always, feel free to contact staff (<a href="mailto:management@rpglimitbreak.com">management@rpglimitbreak.com</a>) if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

        <h2 id="2020venue" class="blog-title">RPGLB 2020 Venue Details</h2>
        <em>December 19th, 2019</em>
        <hr class="blog-post-header" />
        <p>After considering multiple venues and attendee feedback from previous events, we’ve decided to return to the <strong>DoubleTree Hotel-Salt Lake City Airport</strong> for RPGLB 2020. We did give serious consideration to another venue that would provide the main amenity lacked by the DoubleTree (more dining/convenience store/etc options within walking distance), but it unfortunately did not end up having the Internet bandwidth to support our stream and other needs.</p>
        <p>There will be some changes with the venue compared to RPGLB 2019:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>We will be renting more conference room space, to allow for a larger stream room and a private practice room.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>NAMI is arranging for food trucks to be onsite between 5pm-9pm during main event dates (Sunday-Saturday). NAMI will not be financing full meal catering this time, but will be providing snacks and other amenities - exact details are still being worked out.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>There will not be construction/renovations going on at the hotel during the event.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Event dates have been moved back to the 2nd week of May based on attendee feedback.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional amenities unchanged from 2019:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>The DoubleTree has a free shuttle to and from the SLC airport, with 24-hour service (runs every 20-30 minutes between 5AM-10PM, and late-night pickups are available by phone)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Onsite restaurant, bar, and 24-hour snack/pantry market</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Fully online room booking</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Free parking for all event attendees (whether staying at the hotel or not)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Free Wi-Fi in conference/hotel rooms</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The attendee cap for RPGLB 2020 will be <strong>350</strong> - we have an initial block of 70-90 hotel rooms per event night (weighted based on attendance data from previous events).</p>
        <p>Hotel Reservation Info (in the future we may delay releasing this info until registration opens):</p>
        <p>DoubleTree by Hilton - Salt Lake City Airport</p>
        <p>5151 Wiley Post Way</p>
        <p>Salt Lake City, UT 84116</p>
        <p>Phone: 801-539-1515</p>
        <p>Reservation Link:  <a href="https://doubletree.hilton.com/en/dt/groups/personalized/S/SLCARDT-RPG-20200507/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG">https://doubletree.hilton.com/en/dt/groups/personalized/S/SLCARDT-RPG-20200507/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG</a></p>
        <p>Directions/Amenities:  <a href="https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/utah/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-salt-lake-city-airport-SLCARDT/index.html">https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/utah/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-salt-lake-city-airport-SLCARDT/index.html</a></p>
        <p>Hotel rooms (before taxes) are $123/night for 1-2 people and $133/night for 3-4 people, so a 4-person room would be approximately $33 per person per night (plus taxes) if split evenly.

        <h2 id="2020submissions" class="blog-title">RPGLB 2020 Submission Guidelines</h2>
        <em>December 19th, 2019</em>
        <hr class="blog-post-header" />
        <p>Game submissions will be open January 15-26, 2020 (via <a href="https://rpglimitbreak.com">https://rpglimitbreak.com</a>), the game list will be posted on February 16, 2020, and the full schedule on March 1, 2020.</p>
        <p>Game Selection Criteria:</p>
        <p><strong>Length</strong> - This will be a 6 1/2-day marathon (running roughly from noon on 5/10 to midnight the night of 5/16, for about 156 total hours). We want to have as much variety on the schedule as possible (both for games and runners), so 6+ hour runs will need to be very strong in the below areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Donation Incentives</strong> - What we’re here for (along with having a fun week)! Can you name characters? Are there storyline branches/character choices/optional bosses that work in a speedrun route? Are there in-jokes in the game that fans would donate to see (ie the Phantom Train Suplex)? Strong donation incentives will be especially important for longer runs. Note that donation incentive submissions will be combined with game submissions in January.</p>
        <p><strong>Entertainment</strong> - Does the run have interesting tricks/strategies that make for engaging commentary? Is there variety in the gameplay throughout the course of the run? What is the cutscene to action ratio like?</p>
        <p><strong>Game Popularity</strong> - One of the purposes of RPGLB is giving RPGs that aren’t popular enough to make a Games Done Quick schedule a chance in the spotlight; but at the same time we want to have games on the schedule that a decent chunk of our audience has heard of and will stick around for. More obscure games also tend to have difficulty getting commentators besides the runner; and having strong run commentary is a big focus for RPGLB.</p>
        <p><strong>Marathon Safety</strong> - How consistently can your run be finished within the estimate you give? How big of an impact does randomness have on the run? How likely would it have to be mercy killed to prevent going significantly over estimate?</p>
        <p><strong>Language</strong> - As our main audience is going to be English-speakers, English text is generally preferred over Japanese or other languages, especially for text-heavy games. This will be less of a concern for games with skippable cutscenes and/or where the speedrun is easy to follow through animations and other non-text means. Voice acting in non-English languages is always fine, and if selectable can make for a good donation incentive.</p>
        <p><strong>Recency</strong> - How recently has your game been featured in an RPGLB event (annual main charity events only - online community events hosted on the RPGLB Twitch channel do NOT count towards this criteria)? If it’s been in a previous event, does the game have new routing/strategies, or does your submission offer any new run categories/donation incentives?</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Best</strong> - If your game has a community leaderboard, how close is your personal best to the fastest times? It is NOT expected for RPGLB runners to be record holders or close (especially given that the fastest speedruns of many RPGs use routes/strategies that aren’t marathon safe); but having a strong personal best makes for a stronger submission. For co-op run submissions, the individual personal bests of all submitters will be looked at by the committee (since it may fall to any of them to do the run solo if co-op partners later withdraw).</p>
        <p><strong>Submission Video</strong> - All submissions should include a video of you doing a run of your game &amp; category within your estimate. It’s fine to use either your personal best video or a specially recorded submission video - do whatever you feel makes a stronger pitch for your run.</p>
        <p>Defining what is/isn’t an RPG is something we do not attempt - our goal is to produce a schedule of games that appeal to fans of the RPG genre; and the RPGLB games committee decides on a case-by-case basis which offered games are/aren’t good fits for our marathon.</p>
        <p>RPGLB staff will have basic NTSC-U SD consoles (SNES, PS2, etc) on hand for the stream room (though it's recommended for runners to bring their own for practice) and gaming PCs for the stream and practice rooms. For HD consoles (PS4, PSTV, Switch, etc), it is expected for runners to bring their own consoles to ensure no installation/patching/load time issues.</p>
        <p>It is expected that all console-based games will be run on original console (digital ports such as VC/PSN are fine, as are flash/reproduction cartridges). PC-based emulators (BizHawk, SNES9X, ePSXe, etc) are acceptable for submission videos, as long as runners will be prepared to run the game on console at the marathon (including making any needed arrangements for a controller & cartridge/disc).</p>
