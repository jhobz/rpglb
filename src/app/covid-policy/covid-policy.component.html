	<h1 class="title">COVID-19 Safety Policy for RPG Limit Break 2022</h1>
  <mat-card>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in attending RPG Limit Break 2022 (RPGLB2022)! This policy is a living document, and may be updated at any time prior to the event as health regulations, safety recommendations, and changes in COVID-19’s ongoing development occur between now and the event.</p>
    <h3 id="what-are-the-covid-19-safety-requirements-to-attend-rpglb2022">What are the COVID-19 safety requirements to attend RPGLB2022?</h3>
    <p>Our requirements are designed to minimize the spread of COVID-19 at the event. We have built our requirements based on recommendations from medical staff, CDC guidelines, and WHO guidelines. You may find that many of these requirements exceed the guidelines put forth by the CDC. This is intentional, to maximize the safety of our attendees. RPG Limit Break will also provide assistance with some of these requirements.- You must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19, including a booster shot, no later than September 12, 2022. Vaccines must be authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, or the World Health Organization (a list is provided below)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be able to present proof of your COVID-19 vaccinations (physical vaccine card or digital equivalent), and a government issued photo ID. Each attendee must provide their own documentation, we will not accept documents on behalf of another attendee.</li>
      <li>You must be able to wear a KN95/N95/KF94 face mask while attending our event. Proper mask fitment (covering nose and mouth, with a good seal) will be enforced strictly. Masks will need to be worn even on stage.</li>
      <li>You must report if you, or someone you have been in close contact with, show symptoms or test positive of COVID-19 in the past 14 days prior to or during your attendance. Reports should be made immediately to RPGLB safety staff (<a href="mailto:safety@rpglimitbreak.com">safety@rpglimitbreak.com</a>). Details on what to check for and what to do are below.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for complying with all advisories or restrictions that may be in place for travel to or within the United States for RPGLB2022</li>
      <li>You must comply with any government self-quarantine or isolation orders</li>
      <li>You will need to take any COVID-19 tests requested by the RPGLB safety staff, in the event of a possible direct exposure to, or symptoms of, COVID-19. You will not be permitted to enter the event until you have provided the RPGLB safety team with the necessary negative COVID-19 tests.</li>
      <li>You must follow social distancing requirements for each area of our event. Each room in our event will be laid out to help guide attendees towards proper distancing.</li>
      <li>Minors (those under 18) are <strong>not exempt from the vaccination and masking requirements</strong>. Minors must attend with a parent or guardian who is registered for the event.</li>
      <li>You must maintain good hygiene, including regular hand washing and changing your masks at least once every 3 days.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="what-do-i-do-if-i-think-i-have-covid-19-or-was-in-close-contact-with-someone-who-may-have-had-covid-19">What do I do if I think I have COVID-19, or was in close contact with someone who may have had COVID-19?</h3>
    <p>The CDC has provided <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">thorough documentation</a> on what may be considered a symptom of COVID-19. We encourage attendees to be familiar with the CDC guidance when making a determination about their health.<br>
    First, immediately reach out to the RPGLB Safety Team (<a href="mailto:safety@rpglimitbreak.com">safety@rpglimitbreak.com</a>), and let us know. Then, you need to isolate (in your hotel room or residence). RPGLB Staff will need you to get one or more COVID-19 tests in order to verify whether you may be safe to return to the event. It is critically important that you do not expose yourself to others until you are cleared by RPGLB staff and your symptoms have subsided.<br>
    The RPGLB Management may, at their discretion, authorize a partial attendance fee refund if you are unable to attend the event or must leave the event early due to COVID-19 symptoms or a positive test.<br>
    You will need to arrange a return of your badge to us if you are isolating or unable to return to the event. RPGLB Safety Team can arrange this with you (<a href="mailto:safety@rpglimitbreak.com">safety@rpglimitbreak.com</a>). You may designate someone to pick up your badge on October 23rd at 5PM (local time, MDT) at the check-in desk if you are unable to return before the event ends by emailing <a href="mailto:management@rpglimitbreak.com">management@rpglimitbreak.com</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="are-there-any-exemptions-to-the-vaccination-and-masking-requirements">Are there any exemptions to the vaccination and masking requirements?</h3>
    <p>For the safety of all in attendance, we require vaccinations and masking for everyone. RPGLB staff, volunteers, runners, and charity representatives will need to meet our requirements to enter our event space.<br>
    Please keep in mind that we are accepting a number of remote runners and volunteers, and the event will be streamed live, if you are unable to meet our requirements for attendance!<br>
    If you wish to request a vaccine medical exemption, or have an accessibility question, please contact <a href="mailto:safety@rpglimitbreak.com">safety@rpglimitbreak.com</a>. Medical exemptions must be verified and approved prior to attending (no later than October 2nd, 2022). Those seeking medical exemptions will need to provide a signed medical exemption note by a licensed physician describing why an exemption is required. In order for the safety of all attending, those seeking exemptions must also produce a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 24 hours of check-in at the event. Furthermore, you will need to produce a new negative COVID-19 test each day of your attendance, no later than 12PM local time (MDT), to the safety staff. You will be instructed via email prior to the event about which type of daily test we will require, as testing options are expected to change over time. You are responsible for locating and purchasing the necessary tests.<br>
    While we are required to accept this limited exemption, we <strong>strongly encourage</strong> you do not attend without the proper vaccinations, for your own safety.</p>
    <h3 id="what-else-is-rpglb-doing-to-maximize-attendee-safety">What else is RPGLB doing to maximize attendee safety?</h3>

    <h3 id="miscellaneous-information">Miscellaneous Information</h3>
    <p>Please keep in mind that these precautions can only minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection and spread, they cannot eliminate it. Every person should balance their own health and risk factors before deciding whether to attend an event or large gathering.<br>
    RPG Limit Break will continue to evaluate the pandemic’s developments as we approach RPGLB2022. RPG Limit Break reserves the right to cancel, reschedule, or move to a virtual event if it becomes too unsafe to hold in-person. Refunds for attendance fees will be issued if the event is cancelled or moved online.<br>
    If you have any other questions about the COVID-19 policy information for RPGLB2022, please send an email to <a href="mailto:safety@rpglimitbreak.com">safety@rpglimitbreak.com</a>. Thank you for your interest in our event!<br>
